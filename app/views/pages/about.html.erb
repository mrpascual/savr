<h1>About</h1>

  <p>WAVS is a social network for users to find music based off of recommendations from each other.
     A user can create a post and other users will be able to reply back with a comment. A post can
     be about a user wanting to find songs relating to a certain genre, artists that sound similar
     to each other, a playlist for a five hour car drive, the fifty best karaoke songs, etc. Users
     can recommend songs or artists that fit the description of the post. WAVS wants to become a
     social network that builds trust within its community, and to provide them with the best way of
     discovering and rediscovering new music.
