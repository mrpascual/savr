# SAVR

> Project to create a web application for users to discover new music.


## Back Story

The idea behind SAVR is for the user to find new music based off of recommendations from other people. The user can post a song on the site and other users will be able to reply back with a related song they believe that user would enjoy. Users will be introduced to songs and artists from people with similar tastes that understand what that person is looking for. This can also reduce the length of time it takes if you were to test out a library of songs generated from algorithms of digital music services like Pandora and Spotify. SAVR wants to become a social network that builds trust within its community and to provide them with the best way of discovering new music.
