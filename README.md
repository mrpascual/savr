> A web application for users to find and share music with one another


## Back Story

WAVS is a social network for users to find music based off of recommendations from other users. A user can create a post and other users will be able to reply back with a comment. A post can be about a user wanting to find songs relating to a certain genre, artists that sound similar to each other, a playlist for a five hour car drive, the fifty best karaoke songs, etc. Users can recommend songs or artists that fit the description of the post. WAVS wants to become a social network that builds trust within its community, and to provide them with the best way of discovering and rediscovering new music.
