> A web application for users to find and share music with one another


## Back Story

WAVS is a social network for users to find music based off of recommendations from each other. A user can create a post and other users will be able to reply back with a comment. A post can be about a user wanting to find songs relating to a certain genre, artists that sound similar to each other, a playlist for a five hour car drive, the fifty best karaoke songs, etc. Users can recommend songs or artists that fit the description of the post. WAVS wants to become a social network that builds trust within its community, and to provide them with the best way of discovering and rediscovering music.

## Design Approach

The design of the website is aimed for the user to get to one page to the other and to create posts and comments with minimum effort. The website features a navigation bar where the user can either sign in or create an account. Once you click on one of the two options, the site redirects you to a form to sign in with your email and password or a form to sign up where you provide your first name, last name, email, username, and password. When you get through those two options, you will be able to get access to the WAVS community and from there you can create posts, view posts that you and other users created, reply to posts with comments, edit your own posts, and delete comments and posts. Users can interact with one another by commenting on posts.
